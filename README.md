# watchlist

### Overview
An application to allow a film enthusiast to record and track movies they are interested in seeing or owning, view upcoming releases, and be alerted when a title they have intereset in is releasing soon. This app is intended to help someone who sees or hears about a movie they think they'd be interested in keep a record and see information about that film that they can reference at any time.

The idea comes from the many times that I've seen a trailer, or been told about a movie (usually more independent films), that when I try to recall it at a later date, am unable to recall the title. This app would allow me to immediately keep a record and see when I should expect a release date.
### Features

### Technologies
- Java
- Springboot
- Hibernate
- Bootstrap
- MySQL
- Thymeleaf
- Public API (TMDb.org)
### What I'll Have to Learn
How, or the best way, to work with the API (TMDb.org) with Java/Springboot. I may need to learn more about Authentication/Authorization depending on how managed the application will end up. And, depending on existing packages/wrappers, I may need to learn more about working with and converting json with java (gson?). I will likely need to learn how to upload and store files (images).
